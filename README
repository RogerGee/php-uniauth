php-uniauth - v0.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project provides a PHP extension for performing universal authentication on
a single host. The extension contains functionality that allows a PHP-based Web
platform the ability to universally track login sessions. This is useful for
implementing single sign-on within the same physical host running multiple
virtual hosts.

The extension does not actually manipulate the PHP session. Instead it uses the
session configuration (id and expiry) to track login requests and identity
authentication.

The core function is uniauth(), which checks to see if a user ID has been
registered with the current session. If not, it redirects the user-agent to the
specified authentication endpoint.

In the authentication application, one of two things can happen. If the PHP
session does not have a user id, then the application verifies user credentials
and calls uniauth_register() to assign a user id to the uniauth session. Then
uniauth_transfer() is used to transfer the id to the pending session (this will
also automatically redirect the user back to the original application).
